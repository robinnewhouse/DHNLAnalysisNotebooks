description: "The dominant signal uncertainty is due to differences in reconstruction\
  \ of displaced vertices and tracks between data and MC.  \nThis is evaluated by\
  \ comparing $K^{0}_{S} \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$ event yields in the VR and in\
  \ MC produced with Pythia8.186 in bins of $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and $r_\\mathrm{DV}$.\n\
  The data/MC ratio is normalized to the bin nearest the IP where the tracking and\
  \ vertexing reconstruction algorithms are expected to be most robust.\nThe symmetrized\
  \ difference from 1.0 is applied to each signal vertex as a per-event systematic\
  \ variation."
